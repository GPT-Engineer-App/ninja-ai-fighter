# ninja-ai-fighter

lets make a ai inside of roblox in one script for a fighting game (local script)

the game is TSBG/the strongest battleground:
the character is ninja so the ai can attack from 30 studs using the 1 2 3 4 keys (make it simulate that it presses this button ) and make the ai have pathfinding from roblox
remember the AI will be me as ill make the script be only enabled by me

BTW the attack control make the ai simulate like im pressing the keys so that it works
